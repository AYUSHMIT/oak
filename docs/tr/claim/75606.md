# Landing page for claim for Oak binaries with secure logging

An endorsement that doesn't have this claim means the underlying binary doesn't
log securely. This is intended to discriminate between e.g.
`oak_functions_container` (would have the claim) or
`oak_functions_insecure_container` (would not have the claim).
