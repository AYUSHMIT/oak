# Oak Standalone Libraries

NOTE: The crates in this project currently only build with Bazel, as an
experiment to see what the gaps are. So, the following tasks will be missing:

* cargo fmt
* cargo udeps
* cargo

Oak standalone is a collection of Oak utilities that can be used to provide
confidential computing functionality to applications that are deployed into
scenarios where using one of the full Oak stack deployment models is not
feasible.

Oak Standalone is designed to be easy to integrate with an existing service that
provides a normal, unencrypted gRPC-style interface, defined using proto files
and gRPC services.

## Server

The server component is a gRPC frontend that sits in front of the developer's
client application to provide a facade that speaks the Oak protocol.

It's built on the streaming_session.proto service API.

In order to use it, you should compile it into your existing client server
application, but rather than exposing (for example) a gRPC interface to your
application, you will integrate with the Oak Standalone server facade (details
on this this works TBD).

## Client

The client library provides some convenience methods for creating an Oak Client
instance that can speak to an Oak Standalone server instance. Primarily, it
provides an AttestationVerifier that does not actually verify any attestation,
but does provide an attested evidence structure containing the public key that
can be used to establish the crypto session.
