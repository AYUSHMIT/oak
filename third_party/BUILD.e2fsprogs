# This rule is currently broken.
#
# We need to build mke2fs statically, but setting the CFLAGS in
# `configure_options` breaks the build (probably because the current toolchain
# doesn't have `libc.a` and friends that are needed for static linking).
#
# If you remove the `CFLAGS="static"`, you do successfully get a binary, but
# that'll be dynamically linked, which won't work for us. Hence, I've left the
# CFLAGS in there so that people wouldn't accidentally think this works. Maybe
# if we fiddle around with the toolchain a bit this rule will magically start
# working and we can delete this comment.
